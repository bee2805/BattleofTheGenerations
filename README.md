    In light of the quiz craze that arised during the Covid19 Pandemic, I decided to create a trivia app that would bring together individials from different backgrounds.  The OK Boomer mobile game was designed and build using Kotlin and in Android Studio. This App was inspired by the OK Boomer Card Game.<br>

### Splash Screen

I implemented a splash screen that displays as soon as the application is opened by the user. It is actice for 3 and thereafter the user will be directed to the home page where they will need to add their username

![image3][image3]
### Categories

The user can choose different categories that they would like to play.

![image4][image4]
### Questions

There are three different views for each question type. Two of the question types have three options in which you can pick between and the lyric based question view allows users to answer by typing in the answer. As the user plays each category, points will accumulate for each correct answer.

![image4][image4]
### Results/Scores

The result screen displays after a user has completed a category. The score from the specific Category playes is displayed here.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

After setting this up, I went ahead and did some research on different trivia games or apps to get a bit of inspiration for the brand and layout of the app. It was then that I ran into this amazing card game called OK boomer on Behance. After completely falling in love with this whole idea as well as the branding, I mean, how could you not?!!! I got really inspired and decided to base my app on this card game.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Validation on inputs
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: link Here 
* `Plugin` for this.
* ETC.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* It was super exciting to learn Kotlin and build my very first android app!
* Ater getting my muse, which was OK Boomer, the excitement grew each and every day. I had a lot of fun doing the research, especially for the lyric based questions. 
* I had a lot of fun doing the research, especially for the lyric based questions. 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Because of the way I set up my questions, I had challenges when trying to navigate to the next question activity in a specific genre.
* I struggled to set the session storage for the scores from each category from the results activity.


#### Above And Beyond

* I implemented different ways in which a question can be answered - Either a text input with appropriate validation or selecting between three answers.
* 7 questions per category instead of 5
* 4 categories instead of 3

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* I'd like to implement the high scores from each category.
* One last category where questions from different categories will be displayed. The end result will tell the user which generation their soul belongs to
* A light and dark mode toggle in the settings menu

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
